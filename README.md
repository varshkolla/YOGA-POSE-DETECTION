# YOGA-POSE-DETECTION
This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision (YOLOv5) and deep learning mobile net for pretrained model (for yoga pose classification) into a Flask-based web application. The application allows users to upload images and get predictions of yoga poses using machine learning models, providing an interactive way to classify images based on real-time inference.
